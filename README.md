### Can a `Python` package do what `mice` can?

Missing data frequently complicate data analysis. It is established that a robust technique for addressing missing data is multiple imputation. In `R`, multiple imputation is commonly implemented through the `mice` package which utilizes the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) algorithm. It solves the missing data problem iteratively on a variable-by-variable basis and can yield unbiased and confidence valid inferences under many missing data conditions. However, such a standard choice is not yet established for `Python`.

This repository contains code for a model-based simulation study that is used to evaluate different `Python` imputation methods under different missingness mechanisms and proportions to whether they can produce valid inferences. The `Python` imputation methods `KNNImputer`, `IterativeImputer`, `miceforest` and `MIDASpy` are considered.
